## Hands-On Assignment Approach

The hands-on assignments in this repository are designed to provide a combination of methods coded from scratch and built-in functions, particularly from scikit-learn. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms while also leveraging the efficiency and reliability of established libraries.

The assignments are implemented using Jupyter notebooks, which can be installed following the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install). Alternatively, you can run the codes using Google Colab if you prefer to avoid using your computer for execution or encounter difficulties installing Jupyter.
